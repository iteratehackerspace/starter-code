starter-code
--------------

This repo contains various directories that should help you get
started with software projects. 

For example, a starter `React` project is listed in the `javascript`
directory. 

# JavaScript
After cloning this repository, change directories to the `javascript/react` or `javascript/react-native`
directory and type `npm install`. This will install all the
dependencies of the project. After that you can do: `npm run
front-end-server` for react starter or `react-native run-android` for react-native starter to start up a simple dev server which lets you see changes done to your `JSX` in realtime.

# C
After cloning this repository `cd` into the `c` directory
and then type `make`, that will create a binary that you can 
run. Each time you want to recompile the code after making changes
to it you type `make`.

# C++ 
The `cpp` directory contains a `Makefile` to get you started, read the
comments in the `Makefile` and add your project's files as
appropriate, then you can just invoke `make`.
